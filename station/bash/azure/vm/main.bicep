//  vm/main.bicep - run the heliograph agent on a VM, no container at all
// =============================================================================
//  BRING YOUR OWN NETWORK, as everywhere else in this PR: the VNet and
//  subnet already exist, and this creates a NIC and a VM and nothing else -
//  no data disk, no load balancer, no public IP.
//
//  NO CONTAINER, deliberately. Every other host in this PR runs the shipped
//  Docker image; this one runs git, bash and the transport repo's own
//  start.sh straight on the OS, installed and wired up by cloud-init.sh (in
//  this same directory) at first boot. Read that file for the credential
//  handling and the systemd unit it writes - this bicep file only gets it
//  onto the VM.
//
//  NO INBOUND, same story as ACI: no public IP. Debugging still works
//  without one - `az vm run-command invoke` talks to the VM agent through
//  the control plane, not a direct network path from the operator's
//  machine, so there is nothing to open for it.
//
//  THE CHECKOUT IS TRANSIENT in the same sense as every other host, even
//  though a VM's OS disk is technically persistent: nothing here relies on
//  that persistence surviving. There is no separate data disk, and
//  recreating this VM (a new deployment of this template under the same or
//  a different name) starts cloud-init.sh over from a clean clone. Git is
//  still the only thing meant to survive a rebuild.

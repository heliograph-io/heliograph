#  WHEN TO USE THIS INSTEAD OF THE PIGEONHOLE. Only when the station's endpoint is
#  reachable from here. That is unusual - the whole skill exists because it
#  normally is not - but an Azure Function App has a public HTTPS endpoint while
#  sitting inside the VNet, and when that is true the blob drop is indirection
#  with no purpose: credentials to hold, a timer interval to wait, four blob
#  operations to move text between two machines that can already talk.
#
#  THE SCRIPT GOES WITH THE REQUEST. There is no git on the far side, so a step
#  that arrived only by redeployment would turn a thirty-second loop into a
#  five-minute one. What that costs is stated plainly at https://docs.heliograph.io/flare:
#  the mode header stops being a control, because the caller writes it, and the
#  function key plus the IP allowlist become the only real ones.
#
#  IT EXITS WITH THE STEP'S EXIT CODE, like run.sh, so this composes in a script.
#  A step that fails is a result: the log is still fetched, still written to
#  ops-logs/, and still printed.

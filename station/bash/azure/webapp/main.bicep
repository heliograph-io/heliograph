//  webapp/main.bicep - run the heliograph agent as a Web App for Containers
// =============================================================================
//  BRING YOUR OWN. This creates one Microsoft.Web/sites resource and nothing
//  else: the VNet, subnet and App Service Plan already exist in the estate.
//  The plan is a fourth bring-your-own beyond the three every other host in
//  this PR takes, because a Web App has nowhere to run without one - see
//  https://docs.heliograph.io/azure for why that plan has to be Basic tier or above.
//
//  The subnet must be delegated to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms. This is
//  REGIONAL VNET INTEGRATION, which is outbound-only: it gives the app egress
//  into the VNet (and, from there, onward to the internet), not an inbound
//  path. The app still gets its own public https://<name>.azurewebsites.net
//  endpoint regardless - closing that needs a private endpoint, which is
//  extra estate infrastructure this template deliberately does not add. See
//  https://docs.heliograph.io/azure for the full trade-off against ACI's true no-inbound
//  story.
//
//  THE CHECKOUT IS TRANSIENT, same as every other host: no file share, no
//  storage account, no mount. WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE is turned
//  off below for exactly this reason - left on, App Service mounts a
//  persistent Azure Files share at /home on every Linux container app, which
//  would let a checkout survive a restart. That is the opposite of what
//  every other host in this PR does, so it is turned off here to match them:
//  git is the persistence, not the platform.

# =============================================================================
#  pigeonhole.sh - the station loop, over blob storage instead of git
# =============================================================================
#
#  Same contract as station.sh: watch a request, run the step it names, ship the
#  captured log back. The only difference is the transport.
#
#  USE THIS WHEN THE CONTROL NODE CANNOT REACH THE GIT HOST. Not when it is
#  awkward - when it genuinely cannot. A host inside a locked-down subnet may
#  have no route off it at all, and git is then not a transport but a
#  dependency that cannot be met. Every other heliograph property is worth
#  keeping in that situation, so this replaces the poll source and the publish
#  sink and changes nothing else.
#
#  The shape is a dead letter drop: you cannot reach the far side, the far side
#  cannot reach you, and both can reach one agreed place. Azure Blob Storage
#  behind a private endpoint is that place, because traffic to a private
#  endpoint is VNet-local and never touches the route that is blocking
#  everything else. See https://docs.heliograph.io/flare.
#
#  WHY A SEPARATE FILE AND NOT A FLAG ON station.sh. Wherever this is needed, a
#  git runner is usually still working somewhere else in the same estate. Two
#  transports in one loop would mean every future change to either has to be
#  reasoned about twice, and the failure mode of getting that wrong is a runner
#  answering a request it should never have seen. This file owns blob; station.sh
#  owns git; neither knows about the other.
#
#  Everything BETWEEN the request and the log is shared: LOG_DIR and PUSH=0
#  hand run.sh's own capture back to us untouched, so timestamps, ANSI
#  stripping, redaction and the header/footer blocks are identical to a git
#  run. Only the poll source and the publish sink differ.
#
#  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  ENVIRONMENT
#
#    PIGEONHOLE_ACCOUNT   required. Azure Storage account name.
#    PIGEONHOLE_AUTH      'sas' (default) or 'identity'. Identity uses the
#                         Function host's local token endpoint, for estates
#                         where shared keys are disabled and no SAS can exist.
#    PIGEONHOLE_SAS       required when PIGEONHOLE_AUTH=sas. Leading '?' fine.
#    PIGEONHOLE_LANE      which request this runner answers. Default: default
#    PIGEONHOLE_PREFIX    prefix on the container names, for a drop sharing an
#                         account with something else. Empty by default.
#    PIGEONHOLE_POLL      seconds between polls. Default: 10
#    PIGEONHOLE_PROGRESS  seconds between partial-log uploads. Default: 60
#    PIGEONHOLE_ONCE      set to 1 to answer one request and exit
#    PIGEONHOLE_RESUME    set to 1 for a runner with no memory between runs -
#                         reads the last answered id from the status blob
#                         rather than absorbing whatever is in the drop at
#                         startup. Pair it with PIGEONHOLE_ONCE for a timer.
#    PIGEONHOLE_ALLOW_ACTIONS
#                         set to 1 to permit steps that declare themselves
#                         actions. Default 0: this runner is read-only unless
#                         the operator says otherwise when starting it.
#    PIGEONHOLE_NO_ACTIONS
#                         the old spelling of the default. Still honoured.
#
#  It expects four containers on the account: requests, logs, status and agent.
#
#  THE LANE IS THIS TRANSPORT'S BRANCH BINDING. Two runners must never answer
#  one request - a heliograph log's whole value is that it says what ONE
#  machine saw, and two logs seconds apart from two hosts is a failure that
#  looks like success. Git got that from branch binding. There are no branches
#  here, so the lane is the blob path: a runner reads requests/<lane>.txt and
#  nothing else, and no two runners may share a lane.

# THE CREDENTIAL. A SAS is validated by the storage service itself with no

# identity needs IMDS, a service principal needs login.microsoftonline.com -
# and a host with no egress has neither. On a VNet-injected Azure Container
# Instance there is no IMDS at all, so managed identity is not merely
# unreachable, it is unavailable. A SAS is the only credential that works.
#
# THE CLIENT. curl is the one HTTP client that can be relied on. An image
# minimal enough to be worth deploying may have no `az` and no Python SDK, and
# nothing can be installed at runtime on a host that cannot reach a package
# repository. See https://docs.heliograph.io/flare.

#  test-kubernetes.sh - the manifest, applied to a real cluster, running a step
# =============================================================================
# toolkit/kubernetes/heliograph.yaml shipped for months with no test and no
# cluster had ever run it. references/hosts.md called that "validated": the file
# is well-formed and reviewed, and nothing more was claimed.
#
# This is what it takes to say "proven" instead. A kind cluster, the real
# manifest, a station that clones a transport repo, runs a step and pushes the
# log back - checked for the properties the log is FOR, not merely for a pod
# that reached Running.
#
# WHAT IS PATCHED, AND WHY ONLY THAT
#
# Two values: the image, so a local build is used instead of a published tag,
# and REPO_URL, so it points at a git daemon in the cluster instead of a
# placeholder. Everything else - the replica count, the security context, the
# resource limits, the secret reference - is applied exactly as shipped. Patch
# more and the test stops being about the file somebody will actually apply.
#
# THE GIT DAEMON
#
# git:// needs no credential, which keeps a token out of a test fixture. The
# repository it serves is bootstrapped by this script, so the pod clones the
# same toolkit a real operator would.
#
# It SKIPS LOUDLY without kind, kubectl or a container runtime.

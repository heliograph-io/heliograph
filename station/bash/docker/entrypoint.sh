#
#  THREE JOBS, and nothing else:
#    1. Work out where the transport repo is (a URL) and clone it, unless a
#       persistent volume already holds one from an earlier run of this
#       container.
#    2. cd into it.
#    3. exec ./start.sh, passing every remaining argument through untouched.
#
#  EVERYTHING AFTER THE CLONE IS start.sh's JOB. It already owns the
#  preflight, the credential resolution, the branch checkout and the handover
#  to station.sh - PR 1 built and tested all of that. Duplicating any of it here
#  would leave no answer to "which copy is authoritative", so this file does
#  not try. In particular: there is no --branch flag here. A branch to switch
#  to AFTER the clone is start.sh's own --branch, reached by passing it
#  straight through; this file has no branch concept of its own.
#
#  THE CREDENTIAL. caplib.sh - and with it cap_git, the one place this
#  toolkit is supposed to attach a credential to git - is INSIDE the repo
#  this script clones. Before the clone it does not exist yet, so the small
#  amount of credential handling below (entrypoint_auth_header,
#  entrypoint_credential_desc, _entrypoint_git_env_ok) is a deliberate,
#  narrow re-implementation of cap_git's env-not-argv trick, scoped to the
#  one git invocation that has to run before caplib.sh is reachable. Once the
#  clone exists, this script hands over and never touches git's credentials
#  again - the restart path below (an already-cloned repo) reuses the real
#  caplib.sh/start.sh for every git operation that follows, deliberately,
#  rather than extending this duplication any further than it has to go.
#
#  THE ONE THING THIS FILE ACTIVELY REFUSES: a repo URL with a credential
#  embedded in it (https://user:token@host/...). That string becomes an
#  ARGUMENT to git clone, and /proc/<pid>/cmdline is world-readable inside
#  this container exactly as it is on a bare control node - PR 1's cap_git
#  moved the auth header out of argv for the same reason. Putting the
#  credential in the URL is the obvious route and it is the one that leaks;
#  see https://docs.heliograph.io/containers for the full account and the honest limits of
#  what is closed here versus what Docker itself still exposes. The refusal
#  also says the part this container cannot do anything about: a URL that got
#  here on a `docker run` command line has already been in the HOST's process
#  table and in `docker inspect .Config.Cmd`, so the credential in it is
#  spent and has to be rotated, not merely re-passed a safer way.
# =============================================================================
set -uo pipefail

# Never prompt. AGENTS.md's standing rule ("Steps never prompt... a prompt
# through the capture pipeline is invisible and the run simply hangs")
# applies here just as much as inside a step: with a tty attached (`docker
# run -it`, exactly what an operator does for a first smoke test) and no
# working credential, `git clone` over https blocks on a username prompt
# forever rather than failing. Confirmed by hand: unset, the container sat
# there past two minutes against an auth-required host; set, the same clone
# fails in about three seconds with "terminal prompts disabled". Exported,
# deliberately, so it survives the exec into start.sh/station.sh below and
# nothing later in the run can prompt either.

# rather than through cap_run's pipeline. Same two rules, same order, same
# reasoning - see caplib.sh's cap_redact and start.sh's credential() for the
# long version. Scoped to the two URL shapes because a repo URL is the only
# thing this file ever prints that could carry a credential; the key=value
# and Bearer/Basic-header rules in cap_redact exist for arbitrary COMMAND
# output, which nothing here produces.
# -u (unbuffered), the same reason caplib.sh's cap_run uses `sed -u`: this
# is used to stream the clone's own progress live below, and a buffered sed
# would sit on that output until the clone finishes, silently turning a
# large clone over a slow link into what looks like a hang.

# is what BOTH this clone and every later cap_git call inside start.sh
# resolve, without the operator needing to know there are two mechanisms
# underneath. Deliberately narrower than _cap_token_source: no ./.git-token
# (there is no repo yet to hold one) - but the "unreadable:" diagnosis IS
# kept, unlike an earlier version of this file, because a GIT_TOKEN_FILE that
# exists but cannot be read is exactly the shape a root-owned Docker/
# Kubernetes secret mount arrives in, which is the very mitigation this
# file's own usage text recommends for keeping a token out of `docker
# inspect`. Reporting that as a flat "none" - rather than naming the file and

Clones <repo-url> into ${HELIOGRAPH_WORKDIR:-$HOME/repo} - or reuses it
unchanged if a persistent volume already holds a clone of the SAME repo
there from an earlier run of this container. A clone of a DIFFERENT repo is
refused, not silently reused; so is a directory whose origin remote cannot
be READ at all, which is a different fact and gets a different message (the
usual cause is a checkout owned by a different uid than this container's
user, which git refuses to read). Nothing is ever emptied or deleted to get
past either, and no message suggests it for a directory whose contents this
script could not identify. Then it hands over to that repo's own
./start.sh, which owns the preflight, the credential checks, the branch
checkout and the handover to station.sh. Every argument after the URL (or
every argument at all, if REPO_URL is set with no positional URL) is passed
to start.sh untouched. REPO_URL and a positional URL together are refused,
rather than one silently winning.

Credential for an https:// URL: GIT_TOKEN, GIT_TOKEN_FILE or GIT_AUTH_HEADER
in the container's environment - never in the URL itself. Of the three,
GIT_TOKEN_FILE naming a bind- or secret-mounted file is the one that does
not appear in `docker inspect`; GIT_TOKEN and GIT_AUTH_HEADER, passed with
`-e`, do - that is a property of `docker inspect`, not of this script, and
nothing run inside the container can close it.

# =============================================================================
#  A TRANSPORT THAT HAS NOTHING TO CLONE
# =============================================================================
# This entrypoint has one job before start.sh: put a transport repo at $WORKDIR.
# For git that means a clone, and everything below it is about doing that safely.
#
# For the relay, the file share and the blob transport there IS no clone. The
# request does not travel in a repository, the log does not come back in one,
# and there is nothing at the far end to fetch. So the payload has to be in the
# image, and it is: /opt/heliograph/payload, planted at build time by the same
# bootstrap.sh that plants a transport repo.
#
# THE GIT PATH IS UNTOUCHED. When the transport is git the clone still wins and
# the baked payload is never looked at - there is one authoritative copy of
# start.sh and it is the one in the repo the operator controls. The payload in
# the image is a fallback for the transports with no repo, not a second opinion
# about the ones that have one.
#
# WHY THIS WAS THE LAST THING MISSING. station.sh has taken TRANSPORT since A3,
# start.sh asks the transport rather than assuming git, and every transport's
# variables are read from the environment - which a container already has. The
# single reason a container could not run one of those stations was this file
# demanding a URL to clone.

#
# Started here rather than inside start.sh because it is a property of the HOST,

# 1 exits.

#
#   RELAY_SEAL_SHA256 SET BY THE OPERATOR, from the checksum published beside
#   the release, is a real check: a value they did not build compared against a
#   binary they did not build.
#

#   built - a mangled mount, a tampered running container, a corrupt layer - and
#   nothing about whether the right one was built, because anyone who could

#
# Both are better than the third state, which is what happened before this
# existed: no binary at all, and a relay station that refused to start.

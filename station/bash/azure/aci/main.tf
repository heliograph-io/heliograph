#  aci/main.tf - run the heliograph agent as a VNet-injected container group
# =============================================================================
#  The Terraform twin of aci/main.bicep. Same shape, same traps, same result -
#  see that file's header for the full reasoning; this one only notes where
#  Terraform's azurerm provider makes you say something differently.
#
#  BRING YOUR OWN NETWORK, as everywhere else in this PR: the VNet and subnet
#  already exist, and this creates the container group and nothing else. The
#  subnet must be delegated to Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups.
#
#  NO INBOUND, no file share, no storage account. Git is the persistence.

# --- a PowerShell step -------------------------------------------------------
# A step is an argv array, so the runner does not care what language it is in:
# caplib sees a process that prints to stdout, and that is the whole contract.
# A Windows step wants Get-WinEvent rather than a bash reimplementation of it.
#
# ps_step sets CMD for a .ps1 step. It exists so the table below stays one
# readable line per step, and so the two things that make PowerShell output
# unreadable in a captured log get fixed in ONE place instead of in every step
# by every author who remembers:
#
#  Every number below was measured on Windows Server 2022 with PowerShell
#  5.1.20348 and on Linux with pwsh 7.6.5, not reasoned about.
#
#   LINE ENDINGS. `powershell.exe -File` emits CRLF: CR=8 LF=8 for an eight
#   line script, whether redirected to a file or through a pipe. A stray CR on
#   every captured line is invisible in a terminal, wrong in the file, and
#   quietly breaks any later grep anchored with $. Out-String -Stream renders
#   each object the way the console would, and rewriting each line with an
#   explicit LF pins the ending: CR drops to 0. pwsh on Linux already emits LF,
#   so this only earns its keep on a Windows control node.
#
#   COLOUR, and it is NOT the colour that needs this. cap_run already strips
#   ANSI with 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mGKHF]//g', which covers everything pwsh 7 emits
#   for Format-Table: 8 ESC bytes in, 0 out. Removing NO_COLOR changes nothing
#   for those, and an assertion written against a colour-only step cannot fail.
#
#   The gap is OSC 8 HYPERLINKS. pwsh emits them as ESC]8;;<url>, and that sed
#   only matches ESC[ sequences, so they go straight through into the log:
#   measured 4 ESC bytes surviving cap_run for a step calling
#   $PSStyle.FormatHyperlink, and 0 with NO_COLOR set. NO_COLOR is what earns
#   its place here; PlainText in the parent does not, and is kept only because
#   it costs nothing. Windows PowerShell 5.1 has no $PSStyle and emits no ANSI
#   at all, so this is pwsh 7 insurance rather than a Windows fix.
#
#   ENCODING. Forcing UTF-8 is about the OEM codepage mangling non-ASCII, NOT
#   about UTF-16: the redirected stream measured NUL=0, so the widely repeated
#   "PowerShell redirects as UTF-16" does not apply to this path.
#
#   EXIT CODES, and this is the one that would have shipped a wrong answer.
#   Running the step in-process as `& './step.ps1'` leaves $LASTEXITCODE
#   holding whatever the last NATIVE command inside it returned. win-snapshot
#   ends by probing `git config --get core.autocrlf`, which exits 1 when the key
#   is unset, so a perfectly good snapshot reported failure. Invoking the step
#   as a child with -File fixes it: measured 0 for a clean run, 3 for a genuine
#   `exit 3`, and 0 for a run whose internal native command exited 7. The extra
#   process is worth it to stop a diagnostic lying about whether it worked.

# --- a step declares what it is, and an undeclared step does not run ----------
# This gate used to be a list of step NAMES - `reset|destroy|apply|deploy`. The
# hole in that was not subtle: `cleanup-disk` matches none of them and was waved
# through as a diagnostic, while a read-only step that happened to be called
# `deploy` was gated for its spelling. A filename is not evidence about
# behaviour.
#
# So every step file carries, in its first 30 lines:
#
#     # heliograph-mode: read-only        (or: action)
#
# and the runner reads it from the file it is about to execute. Missing or
# unrecognised REFUSES - fail closed, because the alternative is inferring
# authority from a step that never claimed any.
#
# What this does NOT do, and the documentation says so too: stop an author
# declaring read-only and then writing `rm -rf`. Nothing in a shell runner can.
# It makes the classification an explicit statement in the file being run,
# checked at the boundary, instead of a guess made from its name.

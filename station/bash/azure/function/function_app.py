# =============================================================================
#  function_app.py - the heliograph agent as an Azure Function
# =============================================================================
#  A timer fires, the agent answers at most one request, and the invocation
#  ends. That is the whole design, and it is a better fit than it first looks:
#  the Azure DevOps pipeline runner already works this way, one job per
#  request, and nobody has missed the loop.
#
#  WHY A HOST WITH NO LOOP IS WORTH HAVING. Every other runner is a process
#  that stays up. That needs somewhere to keep a process, which is exactly what
#  a locked-down estate is reluctant to give you - and on the estate this was
#  written for, three container hosts were refused before this one worked. A
#  Function App needs no VM quota, no inbound path and no long-lived compute.
#
#  IT SHELLS OUT TO THE BASH TOOLKIT RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTING IT. The image
#  is Debian bookworm with bash 5.2 and GNU sed 4.9, which is what caplib.sh
#  needs - `sed -u` is honoured, so a captured line is stamped when it is
#  produced rather than when the buffer flushes. A Python reimplementation
#  would be a second copy of the timestamping, ANSI stripping and redaction,
#  and there would be no answer to which copy is authoritative.
#
#  There is no git in the image, so the transport is the pigeonhole. That is
#  not a limitation here: blob storage behind a private endpoint needs no
#  egress at all, which is the reason this host can work where the others
#  could not.
#
#  THIS HOST CARRIES BOTH TRANSPORTS, and which one to use is a property of the
#  estate rather than a preference:
#
#    the timer + pigeonhole   when nothing can reach the agent. Still the
#                             common case, and still why this host exists.
#    the intercom HTTP pair   when the agent's endpoint IS reachable, which a
#                             Function App's is. The operator then needs no
#                             storage credentials and waits no timer interval.
#
#  They share run.sh and caplib.sh and disagree about nothing. Deploying with
#  HELIOGRAPH_SCHEDULE set to a date that never comes leaves intercom alone;
#  leaving HELIOGRAPH_ACCOUNT unset leaves the pigeonhole alone.

#  Both routes are auth_level=FUNCTION, so a caller needs the function key. That
#  is ONE control and it is not enough on its own: this endpoint runs
#  caller-supplied shell inside the VNet, which is what makes it useful and also
#  what makes a leaked key arbitrary code execution. The second control is the
#  ip_restriction in terraform, and the two are meant to be deployed together.
#
#  The mode header is NOT a third control. When the caller writes the script the
#  caller writes its `heliograph-mode:` line too, so it is a claim about itself.
#  run.sh has always said as much: nothing in a shell runner can stop an author
#  declaring read-only and then writing `rm -rf`. HELIOGRAPH_ALLOW_ACTIONS
#  guards against the MISTAKE - a step pasted with the wrong header - and the
#  reference says so in those words rather than dressing it up as security.

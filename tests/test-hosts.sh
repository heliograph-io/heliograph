#  test-hosts.sh - every host template is accounted for, and says what it is
# =============================================================================
# station/bash/kubernetes/heliograph.yaml sat in this repository with no test, no
# mention in any document, and nothing saying whether it had ever been applied
# to a cluster. Ninety-one lines of confident YAML that somebody would sooner or
# later run against an estate they cannot easily debug, on the strength of it
# being here.
#
# That is the failure this file prevents, and it prevents it in the direction
# the mistake actually goes: a NEW template added without a status. Adding one
# is easy and satisfying; writing down that it has never been deployed is
# neither, so it is the step that gets skipped.
#
# It also checks the shape of the manifest itself, because "validated" is a
# claim the hosts page makes on its behalf and a claim nobody re-checks is a
# hope.
#
# THE PAGE IS THE SITE'S. It was skills/heliograph/references/hosts.md, with a
# second, looser copy on the site. The two disagreed - about how many things a
# host needs, about which hosts were listed at all, and about the evidence -
# and only the skill's copy was tested. The skill now links the site, so the
# site's page is the one copy, and this is what holds it to the tree.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated so nobody trusts it further than it goes. It
# cannot tell whether a host was really deployed. A row moved from validated to
# proven, with "deployed live" written beside it, passes - and should, because
# that claim is a person's word and there is nothing here to check it against.
# What it refuses is the cheap version: a new template with no row at all, a
# proven row citing a test file that does not exist, and a proven row with no
# evidence of any kind. Those are the ways the table rots by accident, which is
# how it will actually rot.

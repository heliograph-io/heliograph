#  test-remote.sh - reaching a Windows host, and the CR that comes back with it
# =============================================================================
# Two things, and only the first needs a Windows host to observe:
#
#   1. cap_run strips the TRAILING CR from every captured line and leaves a
#      mid-line one alone. Windows is where the CR comes from, but the fix is in
#      the one capture path, so it is testable anywhere and is tested here.
#
#   2. rt_ps builds a command that survives cmd. A Windows host running OpenSSH
#      defaults its shell to cmd, so cmd parses the command line before
#      PowerShell sees it, and a pipe in the script gets eaten. Everything about
#      the encoded form exists for that.
#
# --- what this file cannot do ------------------------------------------------
# It does NOT reach a Windows host. Nothing in CI has one. What it checks is the
# command rt_ps CONSTRUCTS, by substituting rt_ssh for a stub that prints its
# arguments, plus a real round trip of the encoder. The behaviour on the far
# side was measured by hand against Windows Server 2022 with OpenSSH and
# PowerShell 5.1, and the numbers are recorded beside rt_ps in lib/remote.sh. Reading
# a green run here as proof that a remote capture works would be wrong.

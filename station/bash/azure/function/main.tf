#
#  WHEN TO REACH FOR THIS. When the estate will not give you anywhere to keep a
#  process. It was written after three container hosts were refused in one
#  subscription: App Service quota was zero on every SKU that allocates a VM,
#  and a VNet-injected Container Apps environment could not provision because
#  the platform itself needs outbound and the subnet had none. Flex Consumption
#  needed neither.
#
#  IT USES THE PIGEONHOLE, NOT GIT, AND NOT BY PREFERENCE. There is no git
#  binary in the Functions Python image. That turns out to be the feature
#  rather than the limitation: blob storage behind a private endpoint needs no
#  egress at all, so this host works in a subnet with no route off it.
#
#  BRING YOUR OWN NETWORK. The VNet, the subnet and the storage account already
#  exist. This creates the plan, the app and nothing else.

# =============================================================================
#  intercom.py - submit a step over HTTP, poll for its log
# =============================================================================
#  The pigeonhole exists because the agent usually cannot be reached. When it
#  CAN be - a Function App has a public HTTPS endpoint and sits inside the VNet
#  - routing a request through blob storage is indirection with no purpose: the
#  operator has to hold storage credentials, the request waits a timer interval,
#  and moving text between two machines that can already talk costs two blob
#  writes and two reads.
#
#  So this module is the other half of that: the caller submits the script, and
#  storage becomes task STATE rather than the transport. The operator never sees
#  it.
#
#  WORK NEVER OUTLIVES THE INVOCATION THAT STARTED IT. Flex Consumption may
#  freeze or recycle an instance the moment a response is sent, so a thread left
#  running past the response is not guaranteed to finish, and the task would
#  vanish with no record it ever existed. A debugging tool that silently loses
#  runs is worse than one that refuses them.
#
#  Work DURING a request is a different thing and is safe: the request holds the
#  instance alive for its own duration. So by default the step runs inline in
#  POST /api/run, bounded by `wait`, and the caller gets the log back in the same
#  response.
#
#  THE QUEUE PATH IS OPTIONAL AND OFF BY DEFAULT, set by HELIOGRAPH_QUEUE_MODE=1.
#  It was the original design and it is better where it works, because a step can
#  outlive the 230 seconds the Azure front end allows a request. It did not work
#  on the estate this was built for: the listener never started, with both data
#  roles granted, a queue private endpoint in place and the host reporting
#  Running with no errors. Diagnosing further needed telemetry, and Application
#  Insights ingestion needs egress - which is the one thing these estates do not
#  have. Inline needs no queue, no queue role and no second private endpoint.
#
#  A STEP THAT OUTRUNS `wait` IS KILLED AND ITS PARTIAL LOG RETURNED, status
#  `timeout`. caplib writes the capture to a file as the step produces it, so
#  that log is real evidence of how far it got rather than a consolation.
#
#  IT SHELLS OUT TO run.sh RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTING THE CAPTURE, for the same
#  reason the timer host does: caplib.sh owns timestamping, ANSI stripping and
#  redaction, and a second copy in Python would raise the question of which one
#  is authoritative. run.sh also owns the mode gate, which is why the action
#  check below asks `run.sh --mode` instead of parsing the header itself.

# THE TOOLKIT LIVES IN TWO SHAPES and this has to find it in both.
#
# In the deployment package it is flattened beside this file, so `.parent` is
# right. In the repository this file is at toolkit/azure/function/, two levels
# below run.sh, so `.parent` is a directory with no run.sh in it - and the
# failure is not a clean ImportError but a captured log reading
# "bash: .../azure/function/run.sh: No such file or directory", which looks like
# a broken step rather than a broken path.
#
# So it searches for the marker files instead of counting directories. Costs two
# stat calls at import and cannot be wrong in either layout.
#
# HELIOGRAPH_TOOLKIT OVERRIDES BOTH, and is read from the ENVIRONMENT only -
# never from a request. The environment belongs to whoever deployed this
# function; a request is written by whoever can reach the endpoint, and letting
# one of those choose which run.sh executes would hand over the machine.
#
# It exists for two real cases. A deployment that mounts the payload somewhere
# other than beside this file has no way to say so otherwise. And the test
# suite needs one: without it, driving this module from a checkout runs the
# SHIPPED payload in place, and run.sh then writes .station-delivery into
# station/bash - which is correct behaviour on a real station, and in a checkout
# is a local artifact that `go:embed` puts into the release binary. That is how
# a 239 MB binary came to carry somebody's /tmp path; station/embed_test.go is
# the guard, and this is one of the ways the artifact got there.

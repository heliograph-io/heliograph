#  test-container.sh - the properties the image has to guarantee
# =============================================================================
# Everything PR 3 ships, in one file, in the order it was built:
#   1. THE IMAGE itself - what start.sh's own preflight would find on this
#      machine before it ever gets a chance to clone anything.
#   2. THE ENTRYPOINT - clone, refuse what must be refused, hand over to the
#      cloned repo's own start.sh.
#   3. heliograph.sh - the wrapper that turns a `docker run` into one line,
#      including the shapes in which it must NOT throw a captured log away.
# The sections are labelled below; each states what it is responsible for and,
# just as importantly, what it deliberately leaves to the section or the test
# file that already owns it.
#
# Every value asserted below is READ BACK FROM A RUNNING CONTAINER. None of it
# is a fixture this file already knows the answer to: that "echoes its own
# input back" shape is the recurring defect named in this PR's plan, and the
# only defence against writing it by accident is to make the container itself
# do the comparison (bash's own `if`, not this file's) wherever that is
# possible, and to read the container's own stdout everywhere else.
#
# Built ONCE for the whole file. A per-assertion build would make this suite
# unusable within minutes and buys nothing: nothing here depends on a fresh
# image between assertions.
#
# --- the skip -----------------------------------------------------------------
# A container runtime is not guaranteed on the machine running this suite.
# Docker Desktop is not always installed, a CI runner's daemon can be down, a
# sandboxed dev box may have no runtime at all. Silently skipping in that case
# would let a scrollback read as though every property below was checked, when
# none of them were - the exact defect shape PR 2 refused to allow for a
# skipped checksum. So: no runtime means this file says so loudly, on stdout,
# and still exits 0 so the rest of ./tests/run-tests.sh keeps going. It does
# NOT call t_summary in that case. "test-container.sh: 0 passed, 0 failed"
# reads exactly like a trivially clean run to anyone scanning summary lines,
# which is the one thing a loud skip must never look like. Task 4 makes CI run
# these unskipped; that is not this file's job to enforce, only not to make
# impossible.

# HOST_UID - measured, never assumed, and used to build $IMAGE below. Every
# "happy path" fixture past this point bind-mounts a directory this SCRIPT
# creates (owned by whoever is running it) into a container running as
# $IMAGE's own user. Building $IMAGE at the Dockerfile's bare default
# (HELIOGRAPH_UID=1000) only matched that on a machine whose own uid happens
# to be 1000, and this repo's development machine's uid IS 1000 - a
# coincidence, not a property. GitHub Actions' runner user is uid 1001, so
# every one of those fixtures hit the same dubious-ownership refusal
# (CVE-2022-24765) entrypoint.sh is deliberately supposed to raise for a
# GENUINE mismatch, and the whole "clone + handover succeeds" shape of
# assertion failed there - not because the product is wrong (it is not;
# that refusal is the fix for an earlier Critical, and stays), but because
# these fixtures never matched this script's own uid to the image's. This is
# exactly the pattern --ssh already uses for the identical reason (see
# heliograph.sh's own SSH FORWARDING comment): build the image AT the uid
# that is actually going to own the bind-mounted files, rather than assume a
# fixed number. It does NOT touch the DELIBERATE mismatch fixtures further
# down this file (MISMATCH_TAG, BAD_TAG) - those build at an arbitrary,
# unrelated uid on purpose, to construct the very refusal this script's own
# uid must never accidentally trigger nor accidentally suppress.

#
# This used to take the first runtime whose `info` answered, docker then
# podman. On a machine with docker installed and its daemon STOPPED, that
# silently selected rootless podman and ran all 228 fixtures against it. 35 of
# them fail there, reliably, and none of the failures are about the code under
# test: the fixtures bind-mount a checkout and clone into it, rootless podman
# maps the container user to a subordinate uid on the host, and the clone dies
# with "Permission denied" on the .git it has just been told to create. CI
# always has a running docker, so CI never saw one of them.
#
# THAT IS dbhq-uk/heliograph-skill#41. It was reported as the suite interfering
# with itself, because that is what it looks like from the outside: failures in
# a long local run, green in CI, and the same file passing when run on its own
# later. The leak detector in run-tests.sh was added to catch the leftover unit
# or container doing it, and it never found one - because there was none. The
# variable was never the order of the tests. It was which runtime answered
# first, which changes when a developer's docker daemon happens to be down.
#
# So the substitution is refused instead of made quietly. Under docker this
# file proves what it claims. Under podman it cannot, and saying so is worth
# more than 35 red lines that a developer has to be told to ignore - which is
# the state a test suite does not come back from.
#
# It costs nothing in CI, where docker is always up and task 4 forbids this
# file from skipping at all. It costs nothing in podman coverage either: the
# --userns=keep-id fixtures further down ask for `--runtime podman` BY NAME and
# are gated on podman alone, so they never depended on what this loop picked.

# PR 3 whole-PR review, Finding 1 (Critical). `git remote get-url origin` has
# THREE outcomes, and two of them used to be one branch: the read succeeding
# with a different URL, and the read FAILING, both landed in the same message.
# `2>/dev/null` swallowed git's error and `${existing_url:-<no origin remote>}`
# rendered the failure as a positive claim - "already holds a clone of <no
# origin remote>" - which then advised emptying the directory by hand.
#
# The trigger is an ownership mismatch: git refuses to read a repository owned
# by a different uid than the process reading it (CVE-2022-24765). Reproduced
# under PLAIN DOCKER, not only under rootless podman's known uid remapping.
# That directory is the OPERATOR'S checkout and may hold a captured log
# committed but never pushed - the one copy of the evidence this whole toolkit
# exists to carry off a machine nobody can reach - so an operator following
# the old advice destroyed it.
#
# The mismatch is built WITHOUT ROOT, by building the image for a different
# uid rather than chowning the volume: git refuses in either direction, and
# needing sudo would make this assertion skippable on exactly the machines
# most likely to hit the bug. The same technique the --ssh contrast test
# further down already uses.

#  decision 3: a failed push must not lose the log - whole-PR review, Finding 1
# =============================================================================
# THE DEFECT, in the words of the thing that prints it: cap_push, when it
# cannot push, commits the captured log locally and says "PUSH FAILED - run
# 'git push' manually. The file is committed locally: <path>". In this
# wrapper's DEFAULT shape - foreground, no --volume - that path is inside the
# container, and `--rm` was added to every foreground run, so the container and
# the only copy of the log were deleted the instant the process exited. The
# remedy printed at that moment named a checkout that no longer existed.
#
# The triggers are ordinary: --once, `stop: yes`, Ctrl-C on the first
# foreground run the docs recommend, `docker stop`, a reboot. AGENTS.md
# constraint 2 - "a failed run still ships, and a failed push never loses a
# log" - is what makes this data loss rather than untidiness.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS A REAL FAILED PUSH, not a stub that prints the words. A real
# bare transport repo, seeded, then given a pre-receive hook that refuses every
# push. `git push --dry-run` (start.sh's own write check) does NOT invoke that
# hook, so the preflight passes exactly as it would against a healthy remote
# and the failure lands where it does in the field: on the real push, after the
# step has run and the log has been captured and committed. Confirmed by hand
# before this test was written; see the fix report.

  # this machine, one built before the entrypoint fixes below were written, so
  # every podman assertion here was quietly checking a stale image. Found exactly
  # that way: the .git-only ownership test came back with the OLD message.
  #
  # `wrap --build` used to do this rebuild, and that was itself the bug this
  # comment now documents: heliograph.sh's own --build path never passes
  # --build-arg HELIOGRAPH_UID (only --ssh's build-arg does), so that rebuild
  # silently fell back to the Dockerfile's bare default (1000) - not $HOST_UID -
  # discarding the very fix the top-of-file build applies. On a machine whose own
  # uid happens to be 1000 that fallback is invisible; on GitHub Actions' runner
  # (uid 1001) it rebuilds an image whose heliograph user does NOT match the
  # invoking uid, so --userns=keep-id's identity mapping (host uid <-> the SAME
  # container uid) maps the runner's own uid to a container uid nothing inside
  # the image answers to, and heliograph (still uid 1000) sees the bind-mounted,
  # runner-owned checkout as foreign - the exact dubious-ownership refusal this
  # whole section exists to prove does NOT happen. Reproduced locally by hand: a
  # Dockerfile whose own ARG default was pointed away from this host's uid hit
  # this identical refusal through `wrap --build`, and stopped doing so once the
  # rebuild below carried $HOST_UID explicitly - see the task report.
  #
  # Building directly with podman (mirroring the top-of-file build's own
  # --build-arg HELIOGRAPH_UID=$HOST_UID line) fixes that: this image's
